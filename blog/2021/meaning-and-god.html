<h1>Meaning & God</h1>

<p>What is meaning? Is it merely the collection of stardust that makes up the anatomy of humans? Is it just the
    societies that we have built over thousands of years? Is it possibly the large collection of books, cinema, and
    music that we have produced? Many believe that it is the relationships that we form over our lifetimes;
    comprising of children, spouses, and platonic friends. However, can any of this exist without God?</p>

<p>It has long been tradition that people just grow up believing in the divine, parents tell their children stories
    that they in turn heard as a child. This was the "norm" for the better part of the last millennia. But something
    has changed in the last 50 years. The rates of religious belief among millennials and generation z (zoomers) has
    plummeted, with many now preferring to be called "Atheists" and "Agnostics". This would seem
    strange if not for the enormous rise in millennials and "zoomers" becoming involved with social issues such as
    gender, LGBTQ rights, and so called "woke culture". To understand this, it is important that we look to those
    that came before us to come up with a diagnoses for this issues.</p>

<p>Many have heard the motto "good times breed weak men, and bad times breed strong men". This has become so widely
    quoted, that we forget what it actually means. For many growing up in the Western world, pain, suffering, and
    hardship, have been long removed from the society and the fabric on which it sits. Almost all people in the
    Western world will not experience hunger or starvation, thirst or dehydration, and even the horror of extreme
    poverty. Many people living in the West have now forgotten what it meant to be human for the entirety of our
    history. Hunger and thirst were the rule rather than the exception. This still rings true in my home continent
    of Africa, where many still do not have access to basic goods and services. Maybe we can discuss why that is
    another time. But to make the point, the West has lost its sense of what it means to be a human being.</p>

<p>The inclusion of technology such as cellphones into the lives of people has had many benefits, but also many
        consequences whereby people can no longer even have a conversation with someone without looking at their cellphone. People now act as
        if the online world is tangible and that the real world is nothing but a boot-loader for the digital world. The
        boomer trope of the "outdoors" has been satirized so much, that it is now laughable for someone to "play
        outside" or "knock on someone's door". This all leads to people becoming more and more disconnected from the
        real world and the issues that come along with it. Instead the greatest civil rights struggle of our time is
        that someone was bullied online, or that a baker refused to bake a gay couple a wedding cake. These issues are
        trivial compared to the issues that plague the rest of the world. There is a reason that Africa and South
        America are expected to be the leaders of Christian expansion in the coming decades.</p>

<p>Without a God, or even a "higher being", it is impossible to make sense of the world that we live in. If we are
        just a collection of atoms and stardust wondering through the vast, empty universe. Then why is there even a
        point to live? Why is there a point to grind everyday at work, just to rise through the so called "rat race"?
        Without God, heinous acts such as murder cannot be condemned. Why is it wrong to kill someone? It cannot be
        "just wrong", especially when it is observed throughout the animal kingdom, after all, are we not just mindless
        beings that roam the planet like any other animal? It is only through the revelation of God, that we are more
        than just animals; God says that he made man in his image. This, if not the most powerful statement ever, at
        least places humans as guardians of the globe, a species that is made to conquer and thrive. It is only through
        the immaterial that we can find peace and love, in a world of hate, despair, misery. Only through this idea that
        morality is objective can we maintain a society fit to serve its people. Morality cannot be removed from God, as
        God is the foundation for morality and meaning.</p>

<p>If it is true that God exists, then everything in our world makes sense. Meaning is therefore not just the
        pursuit of desire and pleasure, but the truth that we are made in the likeness of God, and from that, the
        ability to maintain a sense of morality. With morality, humans can, and have, built the greatest civilizations
        that have ever existed, each with their own glories and sins; but with glories nonetheless. Without a true sense
        of morality, it is impossible for someone to truly find meaning. Meaning therefore, does not come from
        mindlessly scrolling on social media, or consuming the latest product. It comes from an existential being, made
        of spirit, body, and soul. This the greatest freedom that one can find, a child of God, created in his image,
        living a holy life.</p>
