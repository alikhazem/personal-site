<h1>A Defense Of Monarchy</h1>

<p>Monarchy is unjust, unfair, and only seeks to oppress those that are not in the minority of so called "elites" of a society. In the words of Denis Diderot, "Men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest". To some degree, this is the opinion held by many in the now democratized Western World. However, the terrible reputation that Monarchy carries, is if nothing, a creation of the media and its wide reach. Through a well-argued essay, I will showcase the benefits of monarchy in a modernized world.</p>

<p>In today's world, Monarchy is painted with a destructive past. The perception of Monarchs in the modern world, is one of disgust, hatred, and that of a murderer. People in today's world are no longer warm to the idea of a Monarchy. This is partly, due to the actual nature of a monarchy, whereby one leader retains power over their lifetime and only passes on that power to their heir, which is usually someone in their bloodline. However, in a rapidly democratizing world, it makes sense that many people cannot comprehend a change in governance. Moreover, it is nothing if not natural for government structures to change. In South Africa, a new president is elected every 5 years, with a maximum of two terms per president. This is not unique only to South Africa. In the United States, a new president is elected every 5 years. This means that not only does the president change, but also the parliment, and in turn, the politics and direction of a specific country. This leads to a constant state of instability that not only destroys but degrades the rate at which progress can take place.</p>

<p>Moreover, the instability that takes place on a national level; makes its way down to the people, and thus creates localized instability that can be felt by everyone. This brings the conversation to alternative forms of governance. For a government structure to form, it requires a problem that it seeks to solve. Freedom is an issue that many in the Western world now focus on. For that, democracy gives power to the people to decide who it is they want in power. Equality takes route in the inner human desire for every man, woman, and child, to be worthy of equal opportunity, treatment, and outcome. For this, communism serves the people by distributing resources amongst the populous, with the goal of making everyone equal. However, one integral condition has been left out of the argument as the world has rapidly modernized, that is stability. Stability is a state whereby a sense of security, firmness, and strength is carried out. This is quite adequately addressed by monarchy. Stability addresses the internal human need for consistency in life, especially in a world plagued by uncertainty. As the famous philosopher Heraclitus once said, "The only constant in life is change". While this may be true, it is the goal of government to provide its people with as much stability that it is capable of. How is one meant to carry out a productive, happy, and meaningful life, if they are not sure where their next meal will come from? Where their money will be made? And the state of the world their children will grow up in. This leads many that feel left out, ignored, and marginalized by the current state of world government, in need of a structure that works for them.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is accurate for one to think that monarchy is like any other government system, corrupt, vain, and oppressive. Most monarchs of the last 2 millennia retained their power by the promise that God put them there. This is the fundamental problem with monarchy, it's one of authority and the massive decision as to who is to take control. This can however be avoided. Most regions, countries, and even local communities have rulers and even long-standing monarchs. This can be seen in places such as the UK, Norway, The Netherlands, and Spain. These countries all have historical monarchs that, although their power has been reduced, stand as symbols in their respective countries. A symbol of stability is worth more than no symbol at all. These monarchies are not what you would classically think of as a true monarchy; they are called constitutional monarchies. Whereby the monarch vows to govern by a pre-determined constitution. This provides the people with the "best of both worlds". Where the people can choose the policy of a country by election representatives and officials; and the monarch can influence those decisions whilst living as a symbol of stability and strength of a country.</p>

<p>Even with a constitutional monarchy, power can be taken away from the reigning monarch and the institution. This means that over time, a monarch, and their power can be diluted. That is why it is important to find the right balance between the government and the monarch. Taking on this challenge can be very difficult, as humans by nature are corruptible. This means that using a third party, such as a church, will not be satisfactory. That is why by nature, only a true and pure monarchy can retain power. A government system whereby only the King or Queen can make decisions on behalf of his or hers' people. Although it may sound extreme to the modern ear, this was the standard for majority of human history. Whether it be large empires, or small tribes. Each had its own distinct ruler. Humans by nature are tribalistic; it is imbedded into the very fabric of our being, and thus a monarchy is the only legitimate form of governance.</p>

<p>As the rapid democratization of the planet takes place, many are now turning to an alternative for governance. The failings of democracy, communism, and fascism are inevitable. It is stability that seeds progress and the betterment of humanity. Monarchy therefore provides a constant in a world that's "only constant is change".</p>
