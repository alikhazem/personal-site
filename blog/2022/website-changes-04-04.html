<h1>Website Changes</h1>

<p>As of April 13, my personal website, alikhazem.com is once again being maintained. I have converted some of my older blogs from markdown to html, however, there are still a few I need to convert. I added a new "category" called music, where I will simply upload and add the songs that I enjoyed throughout the course of a particular week. This is just to get me to engage in maintaining my website. I should be done converting the rest of the older blog posts sometime later this week.</p>

<p>The only thing that I see changing in the future with regards to the layout of my website, is possibly returning to using hugo, the static site generator. This would make writing new articles and blog posts a lot easier, however, it does lack the control and the flexibility that comes with writing in pure html. Once everything is finalized and all conversions are done, I will push this version of my site to my github. You can find the repository on my github once I make it public <a href="https://github.com/alikhazem/personal-site">here</a>.</p>
