<h1>Website Changes April 13</h1>

<p>As of April 17, my personal website, alikhazem.com is once again being maintained. I have had my site down for quite a while and thought it was time to start maintaining it. I have removed some of my older blog posts that I do not want to showcase anymore as I have seen that they are severely out of date. I have added a new category called "music" where I simply will share my favorite songs of each week and also create a dynamic list of all my favorite songs. This is mainly to keep me maintaining my website when I do not have the motivation to write any blog posts.</p>
<p>All the source code for my site can be found <a href="github.com/alikhazem">here</a>. I still have a few changes to make but all of them will be available for view in the commit messages.</p>
